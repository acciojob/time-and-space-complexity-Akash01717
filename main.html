	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run an algorithm. The main focus is to reduce the Time Complexity by making the code more efficient.</p>
	<p><strong>Space Complexity</strong> is the amount of memory taken by the program. For example, if the array size is input n, then the Space Complexity is O(n).</p>
