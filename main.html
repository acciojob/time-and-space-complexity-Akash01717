	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is understood as a time taken by the program to run an algorithm. The main focus is to reduce the Time Complexity by making code more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory taken by the program.for example if the array size as input n than the Space Complexity is O(n) </p>
